<title>Distutils</title>

<section>
<title>General overview</title>

<body>
<p>
The Python packaging system is known as "distutils", and the hallmark
of a Python package using distutils is the presence of a <c>setup.py</c>
file. (One can think of the <c>setup.py</c> file as the Python equivalent of
a Makefile.) Although distutils is straightforward to use by directly
running the <c>setup.py</c> with the appropriate arguments, the distutils
eclass makes the process much simpler (and dramatically lowers the
chance of sandbox violations). For example, for the <c>dev-python/id3-py</c>
package the body of the ebuild (other than the header and URIs) could
have been written as just:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
inherit distutils

DOCS="CHANGES"
</codesample>

<p>
Any files listed in <c>${DOCS}</c> will be put in the docs directory when
installed. Note that older versions of the distutils eclass used
<c>${mydoc}</c> instead, but the preferred variable is <c>DOCS</c>.
</p>

<p>
In practice, some tweaking is often required in
the <c>src_compile()</c> or, more commonly, in
the <c>src_install()</c> steps, and the distutils eclass provides
the <c>distutils_src_compile()</c> and
the <c>distutils_src_install()</c> convenience functions:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_compile() {
    distutils_src_compile
    # ...
}

src_install() {
    # From the docutils ebuild
    distutils_src_install
    cd "${S}/tools"
    for tool in *.py; do
        newbin ${tool} docutils-${tool}
    done

    # ...
}
</codesample>

<title>Tkinter (Tk) support</title>
<body>

<p>
Until Portage gains the long-requested ability to depend on <c>USE</c>
flags, ebuild authors who package graphical Python programs will
probably need to check at emerge-time whether or not Python was
compiled with support for Tkinter. Since Tkinter requires Tk, which
requires X, default Python builds do not include Tkinter. It's easy
enough to check:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
pkg_setup() {
    distutils_python_tkinter
}
</codesample>
